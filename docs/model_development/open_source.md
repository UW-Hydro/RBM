# RBM Model Open Source Philosophy

RBM is Open Source software.

Our rationale for moving the RBM model development to the open source community is that we want:
- to encourage other researchers and developers to contribute to the RBM development,  and
- to facilitate transparent development and use of the model

## Unsupported

Due to limited resources, there is not official support for some of the tasks related to using RBM.  We expected that the user comes prepared with some understanding of the model and scientific computing.  As such, these items are specifically not supported by the RBM development community:

- Building and running the RBM model on platforms other than LINUX, UNIX, and OSX.
- Using LINUX, UNIX, or OSX operating systems.
- Writing in the Fortran or Python programing language.
- Development of project specific features.
- Configuring individual model applications.
