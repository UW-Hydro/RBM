There is no formal support from the University of Washington Computational Hydrology Group for the RBM model.  For users interested in using or contributing to the RBM model, we recomend using the [UW-Hydro/RBM github page](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RBM) to interact with the RBM development team.
