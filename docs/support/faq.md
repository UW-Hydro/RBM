# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a C or Python Version of RBM?
At the moment, no. 

### Fortran is old, like the people who often use it, how can I run RBM on my computer?
True, but Fortran is an efficient language and well suited for a model like RBM. For PC, the [GNU compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) is free. For Mac, Fortran compilers can be found [here](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/).
