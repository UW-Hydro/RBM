# Hydrology Models

Note: more detailed steps are given in "Running Model" page.

**Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) **
[VIC] (https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC) is a large scale land-surface model used to simulate surface and subsurface water and energy fluxes.  Energy fluxes are passed to RBM to simulate river/reservoir surface fluxes. water fluxes are passed to RVIC to simulate streamflow.

** Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) **
[DHSVM] (https://github.com/UW-Hydro/DHSVM) is a regional scale land-surface model used to simulate surface and subsurface water and energy fluxes.  Similar to VIC, energy fluxes are passed to RBM.

** RVIC **
[RVIC](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RVIC) is a streamflow routing model typically used as a post-processor with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model.
