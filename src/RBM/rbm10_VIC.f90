      PROGRAM RBM10_VIC
!
!     Dynamic river basin model for simulating water quality in
!     branching river systems with freely-flowing river segments. 
!
!     This version uses Reverse Particle Tracking in the Lagrangian
!     mode and Lagrangian interpolation in the Eulerian mode.
!
!     This version of the model software has the following limited features:
!     
!     1. Hydrologic and meteorologic forcings are from a direct access file
!        prepared by the routing program.  Hydraulic parameters are estimated
!        by the routing program using Leopold relationships describing depth
!        and speed as a function of flow.
!
!     2. Output is written to Unit 20 (specified in the command line for executing
!        RBM) and includes the simulated temperatures for the first computational cell
!        in each segment in the same order as that of the *.network file and at the 
!        same time step.  
!
!     Topology and routing is set up to be consistent with output
!     from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model developed by the
!     Land Surface Hydrology Group at the University of Washington.
!     Model details are described in
!
