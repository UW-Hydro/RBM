# River Basin Stream Temperature Model (RBM)

----------

This is the public source code repository for the **River Basin Model**, **RBM**. RBM documentation can be read on the 
[RBM documentation website](http://rbm.readthedocs.org).

RBM was first applied to the development of a water temperature Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Columbia 
and Snake rivers [Yearsley et al. [2003]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JD01786) as a vector-based model. The grid-based
version, integrated with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model, was developed at the University
of Washington's Land Surface Hydrology Group as described in  [Yearsley [2009]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008WR007629). 
RBM has been applied to river basins at scales ranging from regional to global. A selection of RBM applications can be 
found on the [RBM references page](http://rbm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Documentation/References/).


By placing the original source code archive on GitHub, we hope to encourage a more collaborative development environment. 
A tutorial on how to use the RBM git repository and how to contribute your changes to the RBM model can be found on the 
[working with git page](http://vic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Development/working-with-git/). The most stable version of 
the model is in the `master` branch, while beta versions of releases under development can be obtained from the 
`development` branch of this repository.

RBM is a research model and, as a result, is always under development. Not all sections of the code are equally mature and 
not every combination of model options has been exhaustively tested or is guaranteed to work. While you are more than 
welcome to use RBM in your own research endeavors, _**the model code comes with no guarantees, expressed or implied, 
as to suitability, completeness, accuracy, and whatever other claim you would like to make**_. In addition, the model 
has no graphical user interface, nor does it include a large set of analysis tools.

If you make use of this model, please acknowledge [Yearsley [2012]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011WR011515) and references 
appropriate to the features you used that are cited in the [model overview](http://rbm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Overview/ModelOverview/).
